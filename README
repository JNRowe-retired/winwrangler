WinWrangler is a simple project whose aim is to add additional functionality
to all standards compliant window managers. This means that it should work
under Gnome, KDE and XFCE.

WinWrangler provides a desktop daemon that can be controlled via desktop-wide
hotkeys to do advanced window manipulations that are not normally provided by
the window manager. For example tiling and intelligent expansion of windows.
