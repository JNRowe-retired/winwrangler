WinWrangler is a simple project whose aim is to add additional functionality
to all standards compliant window managers. This means that it should work
under Gnome, KDE and XFCE.

WinWrangler provides a desktop daemon that can be controlled via desktop-wide
hotkeys to do advanced window manipulations that are not normally provided by
the window manager. For example tiling and intelligent expansion of windows.

Features
--------
 * Expand window - expand the currently active window to fill all
   available space without overlapping any new windows
 
 * Tile windows - Tile all windows on the current workspace in a grid
 
 * 2/3 layout - Make the active window fill 2/3 of the desktop while arranging
   the rest of the windows in the remaining 1/3.
 
 * Spatial window switching - Switch active window to the nearest neighbour
   in the up, down, left, or right directions

Here follows the defailt hotkeys. They can be manually configured in the file
~/.config/hotkeys/winwrangler.hotkeys

 * <Control><Super>1 - Expand window
